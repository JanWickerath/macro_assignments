\label{problem2}

A Worker has period utility $u(y) = y$, where $y$ is the period income. He can
either be employed at wage $w$ or unemployed in which case he receives
unemployment benefits $b$. If he is employed he receives $w$ forever,
i.e. he has no risk of losing his job and cannot search for a new job
while employed. If he is unemployed he receives $b$ today and is offered a job
with wage $w$ from the nex period onward. The wage offer $w$ is a random draw
from some known probability distribution.
